# sol-baby-jubjub

Currently a rough attempt at implementing the [baby jubjub](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub) curve in Solidity. Primarily based off the Python implementation which can be found [here](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub_ecc/blob/620dbb661a8a24b29eb92fd488201b988609db9e/tests/sapling_jubjub.py).
